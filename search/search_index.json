Built on top of the popular PyTorch library, <code>ALineMol</code> offers a simple, user-friendly API for assessing OOD performance. It is designed to be flexible and easy to integrate into existing workflows.</p> <p>The library first generates OOD data based on various splitting strategies, then benchmarks and evaluates the performance of different models on this OOD data. This approach helps estimate the generalization power and robustness of models to OOD data.</p>"},{"location":"index.html#installation","title":"Installation","text":"<p><code>ALineMol</code> can be installed using pip. First, clone this repository, create a new conda environment with the required packages, and finally, install the repository using pip.</p> <pre><code>conda env create -f environment.yml\nconda activate alinemol\n\npip install --no-deps -e .\n</code></pre>"}]}
